# Lab 05 â€“ Decision Trees: Forest Cover

## The dataset provided includes a set of properties for different forest cover. In total, there are 55 features.

## Your goal is to train an optimal classifier to predict cover type given a set of input features (54). To incrementally approach this, we will start with Logistic Regression (baseline), move to Decision Trees and finally Random Forest.

## When fitting into Random Forest, pull out a single tree and visualize it. Do a performance comparison between the 3 classifiers.

## Given this classification use case, we will make use of a classifier instead of a regressor.

## Bonus: Optimize the best fit model to reduce time complexity without much variance in performance.
